# PowerBI-Job-Trend-Analysis

In this Power BI case study, we will explore a real-world job posting dataset to uncover insights for a fictional recruitment company called DataSearch. We will use Power Query to investigate and clean the data to find out what skills are most in-demand for data scientists, data analysts, and data engineers. We will then use DAX to build insightful visualizations of your findings. Finally, we will bring it all together using everything Power BI has to offer to create a business dashboard so that we can answer questions for the DataSearch team.

# Exploratory Analysis
We will start this Power BI case study by importing and cleaning the job posting dataset using Power Query. 

# Analyzing Market Trends
The DataSearch team still needs answers. We will continue to apply your Power BI skills to extract data insights with tools like DAX and begin to build unique data visualizations.

# Dashboard Build
Itâ€™s almost time to hand over the final deliverable. We will combine all of the job listing insights discovered into an interactive Power BI dashboard for the DataSearch team.
